# 🌍 Country Capital Quiz Game

📄 **Description - Exercise Statement**

This Java application is a country-capital quiz game that reads data from a file and tests the user's geography knowledge.

**Exercise 3**  
Given a `countries.txt` file containing country-capital pairs, the program loads this data into a `HashMap<String, String>`.  
The user is prompted to enter their name. Then, the game randomly selects a country from the map and asks the user to enter the capital. If the user answers correctly, they earn a point.  
This process repeats 10 times. At the end of the game, the user's name and score are saved to a file called `scores.txt`.
