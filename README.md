# ðŸ§  Java Collections Exercises

ðŸ“„ **Repository Overview**

This repository contains three Java exercises focused on learning and practicing Java Collections, file handling, and iteration mechanisms. Each exercise is encapsulated in its own section and demonstrates specific key concepts:

---

### ðŸ“Œ Exercise 1 â€“ Month Management
- **Goal:** Create and manage a list of months using an `ArrayList`, ensuring proper insertion order and uniqueness.
- **Concepts:**
    - Insertion at specific positions in `ArrayList`
    - Conversion from `ArrayList` to `HashSet`
    - Iteration using both `for` loop and `Iterator`

---

### ðŸ“Œ Exercise 2 â€“ List Reversal with ListIterator
- **Goal:** Populate a list of integers and create a reversed version using a `ListIterator`.
- **Concepts:**
    - Working with `List` and `ArrayList`
    - Reversing with `ListIterator`

---

### ðŸ“Œ Exercise 3 â€“ Country Capital Quiz Game
- **Goal:** Build a quiz game that reads a list of countries and capitals from a file and tests the user.
- **Concepts:**
    - Reading and writing text files (`countries.txt`, `scores.txt`)
    - Storing and accessing data using a `HashMap`
    - Randomized access and user interaction via console

ðŸ’» **Technologies Used**
- Java 17+
- Java Collections (`HashSet`, `ArrayList`, `List`, `HashMap`, `ListIterator`)
- File I/O operations
- Console-based user interaction
